# Ralph Iteration 3: Deep Reflection on V5 Design

## Critical Review Questions

### Q1: Does safety floor enforcement break the MoE paradigm?

**Traditional MoE**: Experts compete purely on activation strength. Low activation = low weight.

**V5 Approach**: Safety floors guarantee minimum participation regardless of activation.

**Reflection**: This is a *feature*, not a bug. Traditional MoE assumes all experts are equal utility. V5 recognizes that safety experts provide value even when not "activated" - like a seatbelt that provides value even when you're not crashing.

**Verdict**: ✅ Intentional design choice, well-justified.

### Q2: Is homeostatic normalization masking important signals?

**Scenario**: User says "implement code" (executor triggers)
- Executor activation: 0.5 (strong)
- After normalization with floors: protector=0.40, executor=0.26

**Concern**: Strong executor signal gets diluted.

**Analysis**:
- The 5-phase design preserves raw activation in `activation_vector`
- Bounded scores are for *selection*, not signal strength
- Consumer can inspect both layers

**Recommendation**: Consider adding `raw_winner` field showing who would win WITHOUT floors:

```python
"raw_winner": max(activation, key=activation.get),
"bounded_winner": selected,
"safety_intervention": raw_winner != selected
```

This makes safety intervention explicit and auditable.

### Q3: Are the trigger words comprehensive enough?

| Expert | Triggers | Missing? |
|--------|----------|----------|
| protector | frustrated, overwhelmed, safety, caps, help | "anxious", "worried", "scared"? |
| decomposer | stuck, complex, too_many, break_down, simplify | "confusing", "messy"? |
| restorer | depleted, burnout, tired, rest, exhausted | "drained", "empty"? |
| redirector | tangent, distracted, off_topic, sidetrack | "sidebar", "anyway"? |
| acknowledger | done, complete, milestone, win, finished | "accomplished", "achieved"? |
| guide | exploring, what_if, curious, learn, understand | "why", "how"? |
| executor | implement, code, do, execute, build, create | "make", "write", "fix"? |

**Recommendation**: Triggers could be expanded. Consider:
1. Adding synonyms to trigger lists
2. Using semantic similarity instead of exact match (future)
3. Allowing configurable trigger sets

---

### Q4: Is the priority tiebreaker the right choice?

**Current**: When scores tie, lower priority number wins.
**Effect**: Protector (1) beats Executor (7) on ties.

**Alternative approaches**:
1. **Temperature-based**: Higher temperature expert wins (more exploratory)
2. **Random with seed**: Deterministic but distributed
3. **Recency-based**: Most recently successful expert wins

**Verdict**: Priority tiebreaker is correct for safety-first design. If you're unsure, bias toward safety.

### Q5: Does the Mycelium integration point work?

**Current**: `context.get("mycelium_weights", self.expert_weights)`

**Issue**: No automatic Mycelium instantiation. User must:
1. Create Mycelium instance
2. Record outcomes manually
3. Pass weights in context

**Recommendation**: Consider adding Mycelium as optional orchestrator-level component:

```python
class FrameworkOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, ..., enable_mycelium=False):
        self.mycelium = Mycelium() if enable_mycelium else None
```

## Summary of Deep Reflection

| Question | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Safety floors breaking MoE? | ✅ OK | Intentional design |
| Normalization masking signals? | ⚠️ Consider | Add `safety_intervention` flag |
| Triggers comprehensive? | ⚠️ Consider | Expand trigger synonyms |
| Priority tiebreaker correct? | ✅ OK | Matches safety-first design |
| Mycelium integration? | ⚠️ Consider | Add orchestrator-level option |

## Next Iteration Focus

Implement `safety_intervention` flag to make floor effects visible.
