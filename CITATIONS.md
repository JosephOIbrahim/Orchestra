@article{he2025defeating,
  title     = {Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference},
  author    = {He, Horace and {Thinking Machines Lab}},
  journal   = {Thinking Machines Lab: Connectionism},

  note      = {Foundational work on achieving deterministic LLM inference through fixed evaluation order and batch-invariance}
}
```

**Key Principles Applied:**
- Fixed evaluation order regardless of batch size
- Parameter locking before generation
- Deterministic checksums for reproducibility
- No dynamic algorithm switching based on runtime conditions

**Concepts Adapted:**
- **LIVRPS Composition** → Cognitive priority resolution
- **Prim Attributes** → Behavioral parameters
- **Layers** → Cognitive subsystems (L0-L13)
- **Variants** → Mode switching (focused/exploring/recovery)
- **Payloads** → Domain knowledge (loaded on demand)

**Adaptation (ADHD_MoE):**
- 7 intervention experts with fixed priority routing
- First-match-wins semantics (no load balancing)
- Safety-first expert ordering (Validator > Scaffolder > ... > Direct)

### ADHD & Executive Function Research

```bibtex

  title     = {ADHD and the Nature of Self-Control},
  author    = {Barkley, Russell A.},
  publisher = {Guilford Press},
  year      = {1997},
  note      = {Foundational work on executive function deficits in ADHD}
}

}
```

**Framework Applications:**
- Working memory limits (max 3 items without structure)
- Time blindness compensation (exchange count proxy)
- Momentum protection (don't break flow)
- Recovery without guilt (rest is productive)

**RC^+xi Convergence Tracking:**
- Epistemic tension as distance metric: `xi_n = ||A_{n+1} - A_n||_2`
- Attractor basins: focused, exploring, recovery, teaching
- Convergence threshold: ε = 0.1
- Stable exchanges required: 3
